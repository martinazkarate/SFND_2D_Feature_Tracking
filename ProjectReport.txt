MP.0 This file serves as a Mid-Term Project Report where all the rubric points are addressed. 

MP.1 This is implemented by push_back frames in the dataBuffer, then checking its size against the size limit and erase from vector begin() when size is excedeed.

MP.2 All Detector types are implemented and selectable by string. The string is passed as CLI argument. Shi-Tomasi and Harris have their own functions in matching2D.cpp.
The rest of detectors are implemented in a common function "modern".

MP.3 Keypoints outside of the defined rectangle are filtered by using the contains() method of Rect class.

MP.4 All Descriptor types are implemented and selectable by string. The string is passed as CLI argument. 
They are all implemented in the same function in matching2D.cpp called descKeypoints().

MP.5 FLANN and KNN are implemented in matching2D.cpp and selectable by string. The string is passed as CLI argument.

MP.6 In KNN the descriptor distance ratio test is implemented to filter outlier matches (FPs). 

MP.7 The counting of keypoints within the ROI is done for all detectors. This data is saved into a data.csv file.

MP.8 The counting of matched keypoints using all combinations is done. This data is saved into a data.csv file.

MP.9 Execution times for detectors and descriptors is logged. This data is also contained in the data.csv file.
